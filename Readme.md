#CarDB

This app is designed to track car prices over time with greater detail and with
more transparency than KBB or Edmunds. Detailed graphs and analysis of car prices
per trim, year, mileage, transmission, and other options are used to give 
a better idea of car prices specifically of more niche cars that are misrepresented
on traditional car valuation sites. Using a database of past listings, more 
accurate depreciation calculations can also be made.
